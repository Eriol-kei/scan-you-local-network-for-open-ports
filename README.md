# scan-you-local-network-for-open-ports
learn to discover open ports on devices in your local network to understand network experience

This repository contains the results of network scanning experiments performed using [Nmap](https://nmap.org/) on a controlled lab network.

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

- **Subnet scanned:** 172.20.10.0/28 (16 IPs)
- **Hosts detected:** 3
- **Purpose:** Educational and research purposes only
- **Tools used:** Nmap, optionally Wireshark

---

## ðŸ’» Commands Used


1. **Identify the Local IP and Subnet**
   - First, I ran the following command to find my machineâ€™s IP address and subnet:
   ```bash
   ip addr show
Output showed my IP: 172.20.10.2/28, which means my subnet is 172.20.10.0/28.

2. Perform TCP SYN Scan

To detect live hosts and open ports in the subnet, I ran:

sudo nmap -sS 172.20.10.0/28


This scan detected which IPs were active and which ports were open.

3. Service & Version Detection

To identify the services running on the open ports, I ran:

sudo nmap -sV 172.20.10.0/28

4. Vulnerability Scan Using Nmap Scripts

To check for known vulnerabilities, I combined the SYN scan, version detection, and Nmap vulnerability scripts:

sudo nmap -sS -sV --script vuln 172.20.10.0/28 -oN scan_results.txt


The results were saved to scan_results.txt.
